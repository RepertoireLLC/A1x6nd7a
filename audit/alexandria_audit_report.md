# Alexandria Browser Audit Report

## Audit Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-21 19:08:12Z
- **Scope:** Monorepo root scripts, backend (`alexandria-browser/backend`), frontend (`alexandria-browser/frontend`).
- **Primary Goals:** Verify development workflow, document existing issues, confirm core feature behaviour, and deliver safe UX + stability improvements without regressing existing functionality.

## Issues Identified
- `npm run dev:alexandria` used unsupported `npm-run-all --workspace` flags, preventing the dev environment from starting at all.
- Backend workspace was missing the declared `nodemailer` dependency, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when launching the server with `tsx`.
- API surface in `frontend/src/api/archive.ts` let raw fetch failures bubble up, yielding generic crashes or HTML/invalid JSON noise in the UI instead of structured errors.
- Loading state + error UI lacked clear affordances (no spinner, raw error text rendered inline, buttons stayed clickable during requests).
- Offline conditions (corporate proxy returning 403, HTML responses) produced unreadable search failures instead of fallback messaging.

## Tests Performed
- `npm run dev:alexandria` â†’ verified backend + Vite servers launch in parallel after fixes. *(manual confirmation via `ps`)*
- `npm run build --workspace alexandria-browser/frontend`
- `npm run build --workspace alexandria-browser/backend`
- Manual API probes while backend running:
  - `curl http://localhost:4000/api/status?url=https://example.com`
  - `curl http://localhost:4000/api/searchArchive?q=alexandria&rows=1`
  - `curl http://localhost:4000/api/cdx?url=https://example.com&limit=2`
  - `curl http://localhost:4000/api/scrape?query=library&count=2`

_All API probes returned structured JSON errors when the upstream Internet Archive was unreachable via the sandbox proxy._

## Fixes Applied
- Updated root `package.json` scripts to expose `dev:backend`/`dev:frontend` helpers and run them through `npm-run-all --parallel`.
- Installed workspace dependencies so backend `nodemailer` import resolves.
- Added reusable `safeJsonFetch` helper and `ApiResult` types to `frontend/src/api/archive.ts` to normalise fetch handling, detect HTML responses, and bubble structured error objects.
- Refactored `App.tsx` to consume the new API result shape, guard state resets, and surface friendly error copy.
- Added dedicated `LoadingIndicator` + `StatusBanner` components and wired them through `ResultsList`, `ItemDetailsPanel`, and `SearchBar` (button spinner/disabled state).
- Expanded Harmonia CSS to style the new banners and spinners, and removed obsolete error styles.

## Recommended Next Improvements
- Consider enabling the built-in offline dataset (`VITE_ENABLE_OFFLINE_FALLBACK=true`) for dev/test environments to showcase results without hitting the live Archive.
- Add automated integration tests (Playwright/Cypress) to verify pagination, bookmarking, and NSFW filtering end-to-end.
- Evaluate proxy settings or provide a mock Internet Archive service for local/offline testing to reduce console noise.
- Audit remaining storage utilities (`loadHistory`, `saveBookmarks`, etc.) for schema versioning and cross-tab syncing as the dataset grows.
